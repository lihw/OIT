Comparision of common weighted OIT methods

Weighted OIT algorithm doesn't sorting fragments.

x and y axis are mean and variance of blending fragment colors. z is the percentage error relative to the ground truth.

McGuire's weighted blend OIT with z bias looks the best with limited computation resource. Or one can use MOIT if ALU is strong enough.
